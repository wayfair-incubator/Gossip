## Before You Start

As much as possible, we have tried to provide enough tooling to get you up and running quickly and with a minimum of effort. This includes sane defaults for documentation; templates for bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests; and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that will automatically manage stale issues and pull requests. This latter defaults to labeling issues and pull requests as stale after 60 days of inactivity, and closing them after 7 additional days of inactivity. These [defaults](.github/workflows/stale.yml) and more can be configured. For configuration options, please consult the documentation for the [stale action](https://github.com/actions/stale).

In trying to keep this template as generic and reusable as possible, there are some things that were omitted out of necessity and others that need a little tweaking. Before you begin developing in earnest, there are a few changes that need to be made.
